# Secure-Financial-Records-db
PostgreSQL portfolio project to showcase secure database design, encryption, RBAC, and compliance mapping for US and Swiss financial regulations.

## Objective
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure PostgreSQL database for managing sensitive financial records. It highlights encryption standards, role-based access control (RBAC), and compliance with U.S. (GLBA, SOX) and Swiss (FADP, FINMA) regulations. The U.S. and Switzerland were chosen to reflect both the global nature of cybersecurity and my dual citizenship, with a focus on countries that have significant financial sectors. This project bridges theoretical security knowledge with practical database skills relevant to SOC and GRC roles in the financial industry.
